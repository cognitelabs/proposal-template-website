# Terms & Conditions
## Joint Accountabilities
Our design and development processes are agile and iterative, often requiring a joint partnership with the client that includes consistent and timely communication. We use Asana to track projects and collaborate in real-time, though are open to other tracking systems.  

Additionally, we will work jointly with <%= data.client.client_owner %> (and anyone else designated) to make determinations as to whether some of the objectives require more emphasis than others, and/or whether new needs arose that were unanticipated. In that case, we would redirect efforts accordingly.

## Termination
Either party may choose to terminate the Statement of Work at any time. This termination must be delivered in writing and provide at least 30 days notice of termination.

## Standard Change Control Procedure
Any substantive change in the requirements or any change in the scope made after approval of the requirements document will be done by: 

* Client submitting a written request for the change required
* Change being evaluated for design, technical, commercial, and schedule implications  
* We will review, and if we agree, will negotiate rates for the changes in writing as acceptance of the the listed implications along with the commercial implications.
