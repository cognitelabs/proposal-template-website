## Why Us?
Both of Cognite Labs' partners are heavily involved in the Lansing Startup community, making them particularly well-positioned to create a valuable asset, that also exists in the context of the broader community. Jesse runs StartupLansing, the Lansing Code Lab, and founded Tech Tuesday. Dave runs Startup Grind Lansing. Together, their
efforts educate, inspire, and connect hundreds of entreprenuers in mid-Michigan, including many students, alumni, and faculty of Michigan State University.
